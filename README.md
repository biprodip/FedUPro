Decentralized uncertainty guided prompt tuning for reliable multi-client multi-modal generalization.  
In a multi-client environment, multiple agents gather information from local data and collaborate to learn together and develop robust intelligence.  
This research is focused on multimodeal collaborative learning based on VLM.  
The final version of the code will be released with full documentation as soon as the paper is published.
